name: CodeQL Security Analysis

# CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine
# It treats code as data and runs queries to find security vulnerabilities

# WHAT IS CODEQL?
# CodeQL analyzes code by:
# 1. Building a database from your source code
# 2. Running queries against this database
# 3. Finding patterns that indicate security issues
#
# It can detect: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, path traversal, 
# insecure deserialization, and many more vulnerability types

          # For JavaScript, we can use different query suites:

      # Step 3: Autobuild

The CodeQL security analysis has finished scanning for vulnerabilities.

**What was checked:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure cryptography
- Hard-coded secrets
- And 100+ other security issues

**Next steps:**
1. Review any alerts in the [Security tab](${context.payload.repository.html_url}/security/code-scanning)
2. Fix critical and high severity issues before merging
3. Document or dismiss false positives

# EDUCATIONAL NOTES:
#
# CODEQL VS OTHER SCANNERS:
# - Traditional linters: Pattern matching (fast but shallow)
# - CodeQL: Semantic analysis (slower but thorough)
# - Dynamic scanners: Test running code (finds runtime issues)
# - CodeQL: Static analysis (finds issues without running code)
#
# WHY CODEQL IS SPECIAL:
# 1. Understands code flow (follows data through functions)
# 2. Finds complex vulnerabilities (multi-step exploits)
# 3. Low false positive rate (smart about context)
# 4. Customizable (write your own queries)
#
# REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
# CodeQL can track: user_input → function_a → function_b → database_query
# And detect: "This user input flows to SQL query without sanitization = SQL injection"
#
# QUERY SUITES EXPLAINED:
# - default: Standard security checks
# - security-extended: More comprehensive, may have more false positives
# - security-and-quality: Security + code quality issues
#
# INTERPRETING RESULTS:
# - Each alert shows the vulnerable code path
# - Click "Show paths" to see data flow
# - Review fix suggestions
# - Can dismiss false positives with justification
#
# BEST PRACTICES:
# 1. Run on every PR (catch issues early)
# 2. Run on schedule (find new vulnerabilities in old code)
# 3. Don't ignore warnings without investigation
# 4. Keep CodeQL action version updated
# 5. Consider custom queries for project-specific issues
#
# LIMITATIONS:
# - Can't find all vulnerabilities (no tool can)
# - Requires proper configuration for some languages
# - May produce false positives (review carefully)
# - Can't detect business logic flaws
# - Doesn't replace security testing and code review
#
# CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
# 1. Add custom queries in .github/codeql/
# 2. Adjust query suites based on needs
# 3. Configure paths to exclude
# 4. Set up SARIF upload to other tools
# 5. Integrate with issue tracking systems
#
# ADVANCED USAGE:
# - Write custom CodeQL queries for project-specific vulnerabilities
# - Use CodeQL CLI locally during development
# - Create custom rule packs for your organization
# - Integrate with security dashboards
#
# COMPLIANCE:
# Many security standards require static analysis:
# - PCI DSS: Requirement 6.3.2
# - OWASP ASVS: V14 (Configuration)
# - ISO 27001: A.14.2.5
#
# CodeQL helps meet these requirements automatically.
